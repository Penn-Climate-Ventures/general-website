  //    1. Download the image into the static/team folder, if it exists
  //        - Rename the image to "FirstnameLastname.jpg"
  //        - If no headshot exists, leave field out
  //    2. Add the JSON data for the person into this list (example for Ryoma Harris above)
  //        - Follow the same format as in the example above
  //        - Make sure spelling is correct, particularly for teams and headshotImage
