          Please note that this program is separate from our leadership team. While leadership is a
          minimum year-long commitment, our Fellowships program is a semester long commitment - your
          commitment is tied to your project. We do this because our selection of projects varies
          greatly and may require completely different skills cohort to cohort. However, as a
          consultant and intern participating in our Fellowships program, you will have access to
          our Discord/all internal happenings/alum network, be invited to all socials and internal
          activities, and find a lifelong community of students passionate about climate,
          technology, and innovation.
