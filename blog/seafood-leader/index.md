Last Thursday, President Trump announced that we would now allow commercial fishing in one of the world’s largest ocean reserves. This reserve is located in the Pacific Ocean, and is home to vast coral atolls and many endangered species such as sea turtles and certain species of whales. 

This policy change came as the result of an executive order which directly opened up the Pacific Islands Heritage Marine National Monument, located 750 miles west of Hawaii. The heritage site was originally established by President George W. Bush, and since then has been expanded, allowing for wildlife to flourish. This executive order will cause extreme direct harm to the previously 500,000 protected square miles. 

On top of this executive order, President Trump signed a second order that aims to open investigations into other heritage sites, with the aim to open more areas to commercial fishing. The reason for all of this, according to President Trump, is that “The United States should be the world’s dominant seafood leader.” Trump has expressed frustration that it should not take days or travel for boats to move into areas where they are legally allowed to fish. 

Maxx Phillips, director of Hawaii and Pacific Islands at the Center for Biological Diversity, has said that these executive orders are “slap in the face to science.” Many believe that a dangerous precedent is being set in which public lands and oceans are being given to the highest bidder, in this case the commercial fishing industry. 

Many opposing Trump’s decisions have two main arguments as to why his statements are incorrect. The first argument is that the ocean, especially the Pacific Ocean, is large enough to provide adequate fishing areas, even when there are protected areas like the Pacific Islands Heritage Marine National Monument. The second argument is that these heritage sites are actually helpful and necessary for commercial fishing because they provide an area where fish can accumulate and repopulate, thus ultimately creating a higher density of fish. 

It is clear that these two executive orders are going to be extremely harmful to aquatic life in the Pacific Ocean. What is most fearful however is that these executive orders could be setting a precedent for the government overtaking previously protected lands and oceans across the United States.
